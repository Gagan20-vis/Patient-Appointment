# Patient Appointment Booking System with Doctor

This is a web-based application that allows patients to book appointments with doctors. The system provides essential features such as user authentication, patient registration, appointment booking, and appointment approval/denial by doctors. The application is built using Java Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), MySQL database, and Bootstrap for frontend styling.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can register as patients and doctors.
   - Users can log in and log out securely using session management.

2. **Patient Registration**:
   - Patients can create an account by providing necessary details like name, email, and password.
   - Account information is stored securely in the database.

3. **Appointment Booking**:
   - Authenticated patients can book an appointment with their preferred doctor.
   - Patients can select the date and time for the appointment.
   - Appointments are stored in the database along with patient and doctor details.

4. **Appointment Approval/Denial**:
   - Authenticated doctors can view the pending appointment requests.
   - Doctors can approve or deny appointments based on their availability or other factors.
   - The status of each appointment (approved, denied, pending) is updated in the database.
